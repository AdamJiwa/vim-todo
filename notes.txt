nvim --cmd "set rtp+=$(pwd)" .

Lua creating window is apparently not for extra splits but floating or externals
To get a split using the vim command and then to attach a buffer you have to get
the Id of the win. This is confusing as nvim_create_win should be the correct
method then.

lua's os date behaving funny.

as a buffer is differnt then a window setting the buffers name to a file that is
already a buffer causes an error so we will need to check if that buffer exists
first. also need to tell the buffer to re-read the file?
